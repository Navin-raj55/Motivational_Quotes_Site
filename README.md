# Motivational_Quotes_Site
Welcome to my motivational quotes site!

I developed this site using basic HTML and CSS for my own educational purposes. It's a place where you can find inspiring quotes to lift your spirits and motivate you.

Technologies Used :

HTML: For structuring the content.

CSS: For styling the site and making it visually appealing.

This project helped me improve my web development skills. I hope you find it inspiring!
